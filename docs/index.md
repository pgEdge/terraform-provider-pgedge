  The pgEdge provider is used to interact with the resources supported by pgEdge.
  It allows you to manage various aspects of your pgEdge infrastructure, including databases, clusters, cloud accounts, SSH keys, and backup stores.
  Authentication
  The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
  You can provide your credentials via environment variables:
  Set the PGEDGE_CLIENT_ID environment variable for your pgEdge Client ID.Set the PGEDGE_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable for your pgEdge Client Secret.
  Example provider configuration:
  
  # Configure the pgEdge Provider
  provider "pgedge" {}
  
  # Set environment variables
  # export PGEDGE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
  # export PGEDGE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"

- Set the PGEDGE_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable for your pgEdge Client Secret.

Example provider configuration:

```hcl
# Configure the pgEdge Provider
provider "pgedge" {}

# Set environment variables
# export PGEDGE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
# export PGEDGE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```
